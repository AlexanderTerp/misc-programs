# A-Star Pathfinding
This folder contains my implementation of the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). Includes a seperate file for the heap structure employed to keep track of nodes with lowest f_costs.

### To use (e.g. on map3):
> gcc -std=c99 -Wall -o main main.c
> main maps/map3
