# Z-sort
A sorting algorithm that I dubbed 'z-sort' before I found out it existed already (as I suspected) and is known as the "Cocktail shaker sort". 

It's a O(n^2) sorting algorithm. This particular program has options to print out the steps performed. When this is done, a kind of zig-zag or 'z' pattern can be seen, hence what I named it. Works on both Linux and Windows machines.

This folder also contains 'rng.py', which is just a small generic program that generates random numbers in a text file to test the algorithm on.
