# N Puzzle
This is an implementation of the famous [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) game, although the program is easily configurable to work in any dimensions, hence the N. To play, enter the number on the piece you'd like to move.

Ideas:
- Prevent Loyd's infamous 15-14 problem.
- Have a victory condition that gets checked.
- Perhaps implement simpler controls, utilizing the arrow keys.
- Perhaps have a game solver that shows a step-by-step solution.
- Perhaps add a timer.
