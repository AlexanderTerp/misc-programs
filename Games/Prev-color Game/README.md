# Prev-color Game
This a simple game in which the player is presented with an initial color. Afterwards, they are presented with another. They then have to input left arrow or right arrow to indicate whether the current color is the same as the previous color. This occurs e.g. 10 times (macro defined in the file), after which the player is presented with a score of how many they got correct and how long they took. 

The challenge is to get all of them correct as fast as possible (or as many correct as fast as possible).

Depends on [clint](https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint).

TODO:
- Make Unix compatible.
